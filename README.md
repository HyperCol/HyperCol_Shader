# Main

This shader is based on nothing but build by Eplor.
Some of the outsource code is licensed.
For years, We've been thinking about how to make a popular, high-performance shader that doesn't homogenize with the world.This work is a small attempt to my idea, let me understand the world's choice of my dream.I hope you like this shader.

## How to use it

First of all, you have to have a Minecraft.And you need to install OptiFine.You can find detailed installation methods in the [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).After that, you need to put the downloaded shader in the following path.

```markdown
%.minecraft%\shaderpacks\
```

>If you can not find `%shaderpacks%`, just create one.
